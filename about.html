      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Camila P Ferreira</h3>
      <p>
        I currently reside in Valencia, Spain. I hold a degree in chemical
        engineering. However, my innate inclination towards exploration has led
        me to delve into various fields of knowledge, including software
        development and psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey began during my university years, working in
        industries such as Solvay and 3M. Meanwhile, a significant part of my
        career was forged in the technological sphere, taking on roles spanning
        diverse areas such as Marketing, Product, and Growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the motivations that drove me to study psychology was the need to
        address the challenges inherent in the business world, such as
        work-related suffering, which can lead, for example, to burnout
        syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my professional endeavors, I have always nurtured a passion
        for software development. The ability to create solutions, innovate, and
        contribute to the ever-evolving digital landscape has been a driving
        force in my journey. I am drawn to the intricacies of coding, the
        creativity it allows, and the problem-solving mindset it cultivates. My
        aspiration to deepen my understanding and proficiency in software
        development remains a constant pursuit.
